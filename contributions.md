### Apache Flink Connector DynamoDB

Java library that provides Apache Flink connector sink for AWS DynamoDB database that can be used with Flink 1.8 runtime version.

### Debian / Ubuntu packages

Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project. I was rather ambitious and aimed to package `SQuirreL` client and its dependencies starting from `rsyntaxtextarea` library.
