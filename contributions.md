Spring Cloud Netflix project provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms.

### Debian / Ubuntu packages

Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project. I was rather ambitious and aimed to package `SQuirreL` client and its dependencies starting from `rsyntaxtextarea` library.
