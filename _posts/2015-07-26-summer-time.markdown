Last week we had an opportunity to enjoy a few great vacation days.
This was the first time since Jegor birth when we managed to plan our vacation times together.
The most exciting part was our trip to [Ventspils](http://www.ventspils.lv/).

*Me and Jegor Happy*

We were lucky to get there during [Kurland Bike Meet](http://www.ventspils.lv/eng/gallery/entertainment/293-kurland-bike-meet-2011) event. This was great! I have never witnessed such concentration of bikes and people in the skin before. Hopefully could join them in some future.

Hopefully we will manage to get there this year again.
