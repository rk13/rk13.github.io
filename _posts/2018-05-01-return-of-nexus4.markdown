I started to use Android as my primary mobile platform back to 2010 with legendary [LG Optimus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Optimus_series)
However, as soon as I realized the power and stability of [Google Nexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Nexus) the choice for my future devices was always predetermined: Nexus 4, Nexus 5X ...

I used [Nexus 4 E960](https://www.gsmarena.com/lg_nexus_4_e960-5048.php) device for quite a long time from 2012. Thanks to its vanilla Android and OS updates from 4.2 up to 5.1.1 it was working flawlessly until the end of 2015. Unfortunately, due to the old not-easily replaceable battery and accidentally broken display, it was changed to shiny Nexus 5X and forgotten for two years until it was found by Jegor.

*Broken and spare LCD display*

We realized that Nexus4 has quite good changes to be reincarnated using some spare parts. So after we have received new spare LCD Display with Touch Screen, Frame and new OEM 2100mAh Battery from eBay, the operation "Saving Private Nexus4" has begun.
Although Nexus4 has monoblock form-factor it is still possible to upgrade its battery and LCD display at home using some instruction from the Internet.

So after an hour of hard work and some panic moments, Jegor became the owner of 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon device with 2GB of RAM with shiny new Display screen and battery.
Ideal for MindCraft mission :).
