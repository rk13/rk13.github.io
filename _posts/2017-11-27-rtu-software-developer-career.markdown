Last week I gave a presentation titled "Software developer career" to IT students of Riga Techical University.

I liked it very much to speak on this topic. This is partly because it's always advisable to present on what you know and are doing on a daily basis. But also it was quite challenging to present such topic for almost hundred students.

The slides can be found [here](/resources/2017-11-27-rtu-software-developer-career-1.pdf).
