This year I have facilitated the Global Day of Coderetreat event @ Klarna in Stockholm.
I did presentation on CodeRetreat sessions at Klarna with focus on the fundamentals of software development and design problem-solving principles. 

### Coderetreat

Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular design and clean code, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

The following is emphasized

* Self-exploration
* Craft of programming
* Different design techniques
* Clean code
* Pair programming
* TDD 
* and more...

### Kata: Conwayâ€™s Game of life

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

### Conclusion

Despite less than half of planned attended, people had so much fun hacking together, laughing at geeky jokes as well as sharing experience. The task, facility, people, pizza: all of it was perfect!
