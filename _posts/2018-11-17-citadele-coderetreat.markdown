This year Latvian Developers Network with the support from Bank Citadele hosted the Global Day of Coderetreat 2018 in Riga, Latvia.

Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular design and clean code, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

Despite less than half of planned attended, people had so much fun hacking together, laughing at geeky jokes as well as sharing experience. The task, facility, people, pizza: all of it was perfect!
