This year Latvian Developers Network with the support from Bank Citadele hosted the Global Day of Coderetreat 2018 in Riga, Latvia.

### Coderetreat

Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular design and clean code, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

The following is emphasized

* Self-exploration
* Craft of programming
* Different design techniques
* Clean code
* Pair programming
* TDD 
* and more...

### Kata: Rectangle

The following code kata was selected for the event.

Given N axis-aligned rectangles, determine if they all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region without overlap.
Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point. 

For example, a unit square is represented as [1,1, 2,2]. (coordinate of bottom-left point is (1, 1) and top-right point is (2, 2)).
